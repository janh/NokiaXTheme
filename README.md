Custom theme on Nokia X
=======================

![](/assets/screenshots.png "Screenshots of the included themes")

This app project shows how to add a custom theme for the Nokia X platform to an Android application. The theme is chosen at runtime depending on the device the app runs on, so you can use a single codebase to target Nokia X and other Android devices.

The included themes are designed to be implementable in most apps, as they focus mainly on the action bar and reuse the default Android themes otherwise. The app implements dark and light themes, as well as a light theme with dark action bar. You can switch between these by uncommenting the corresponding lines in *Helpers.java*.

The source files for the used images are availabel in the *assets* folder. You can also find versions of the three themes for the action bar compatibility library in there.
